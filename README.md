# Resurgens

This is my personal website, displaying my portfolio, background, and contact information. I have used Elixir/Phoenix for the backend and ReactJS with Redux for the front end. I have created each React component from scratch, complete with CSS styling for animation and formatting.

Current release version: n/a
Current version on [github](https://github.com/davelively14/resurgens): 0.2d
